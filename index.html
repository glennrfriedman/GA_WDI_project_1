		Hello, welcome to SnakeBoy: Color!<br>
		<br>
		The object of the game is to collect as much food as possible for SnakeBoy.<br>
		The more food you eat, the more points you get!<br>
		The more obstacles on the board, the more points you get per piece of food eaten<br>
		SnakeBoy is the green box that starts in the top left of your screen.<br>
		Move SnakeBoy by using the arrow keys (up, down, left right).<br>
		Pause the game using the space bar!<br>
		Everytime SnakeBoy eats a piece of food (the blue boxes) another piece of food will be generated as well as a new obsticle.
		<br> Avoid obsticles and the walls of SnakeBoy's box to keep playing!<br>
		Select your speed at the top of the game page!<br>
		<br>
		Good luck!
